# User Story #3: Create a new playlist
## Primary Goal: As a logged in user (see User Story #2: Logging into HeartBeats), I want to create a new playlist.
With account information verified and permissions granted to the app for use of Fitbit data, the app will prompt a variety of music genres and artists for me to select. The app will know my music preference via my Spotify data. I can see my heart rate on my left side of the screen, and the newly recommended playlist on the right side of the screen. I can also adjust my mood influence the songs being added to the playlist via a button.
