# User Story #6: Account Information Page
## Primary Goal: As a logged in user (see User Story #2: Logging into HeartBeats), I want to access account information.
When I click the account button right next to the mood button, I am met with a simple page that provides account information such as my user name, email address, previous playlists and a button to log out. The logout button is also permanently located at the top right side of the page.
