User Story #1: New User
Primary Goal: As a new user with Spotify and Fitbit account credentials, I want to create an account for HeartBeats.
	When I open the app, I am met with a screen that allows me to sign in via Spotify. Upon signing into Spotify, a new account for HeartBeats is generated. Because I am a new user, I also need to allow access to my Fitbit account. If I give access, the app will be ready to produce a playlist based on my current heart rate. If I do not give access, a prompt informs me that access must be provided before a playlist can be generated.
