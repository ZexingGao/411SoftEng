# User Story #4: Listening to previously created playlists
## Primary Goal: As a logged in user (see User Story #2: Logging into HeartBeats), I want to listen to a playlist I have already made. 
First, I will go to a dashboard where all of my previously created playlists are saved. Because I am doing my normal workout routine, I know roughly what my average BPM will be. I choose my regular workout playlist, and it opens in the spotify app.
