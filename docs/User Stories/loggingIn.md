# User Story #2: Logging into the App
## Primary Goal: As a user with a HeartBeats account (see User Story #1: New User), I want to log into my account.
When I open the app, I am met with a screen that allows me to sign in via Spotify. I click that option and the app loads my account. Now, I can see my account information and previously created playlists.
