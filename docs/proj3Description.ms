Team 2 HeartBeats decides to use Fitbit Studio as development environment since it will provide a simple access to Fitbit API for future development. For the front-end design, we decide to implement our code through HTML and CSS as well as Javascript. On the other hand, we will use Javascript as a primary back-end language to implement actions such as  data retrieval as well as data storing. We considered using Python Flask framework prior to making current decision. Because flask is a micro framework for python which is based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2, it is to the best interest of the  team to develop a project with great scalability . For back-end database, we would like to use MongoDB as our database to store users’ account information as well as  playlists. Due to the fact that this project is a web-application, we decide that the process of software development should follow a MVC model and the team should develop the project using Agile Development: Scrum to develop and simulate the product.
